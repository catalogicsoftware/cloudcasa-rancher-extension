7) Once the repository is cloned and your development environment is set up, run the command: `yarn build-pkgs cloud-casa-extension`.
8) After the build is complete, run the following command: `yarn serve-pkgs`.
9) Now that the extension is being served, head over to Rancher where you have the "Developer Load" page open, and paste the following command into the "Extension URL" text input field: `http://127.0.0.1:4500/cloud-casa-extension-0.1.3/cloud-casa-extension-0.1.3.umd.min.js`.
